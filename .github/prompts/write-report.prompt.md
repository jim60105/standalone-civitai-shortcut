Development progress for this project is systematically tracked within the `.github/reports` directory. Treat all past reports as immutable references—do not edit or revise them under any circumstance. Upon the completion of each task, you are required to generate a new comprehensive work report. Refer to the naming conventions of existing files to determine an appropriate filename. 

Your report must include a detailed account of the work performed, encompassing all relevant code modifications and corresponding test outcomes.

Write a report following #file:./.github/reports/REPORT_TEMPLATE.md and #file:./.github/reports/README.md in Chinese. 

Follow the template exactly. For any field that requires a value generated by a command (like the date), you must actually run the specified command to get the value—do not fill it in manually or make assumptions. Always execute the command and use its output before updating the report.

Strictly follow REPORT_TEMPLATE.md. All date fields must be set using the output of date -u +"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ". Run the command first, then update the report.

Do not manually fill in any field that should be generated by a command. Always run the command to get the correct value before proceeding.
