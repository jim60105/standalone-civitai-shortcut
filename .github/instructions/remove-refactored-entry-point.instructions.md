We have completed a major refactor and now need to remove the old entry point from the project.

The old entry point to be removed is ${input:entry-point.py:the entry point file name}.

Please follow these steps:

1. For each public function in the entry point file:
    - #file_search Find all usages of that function within the project.
    - Replace those function calls with calls to the new underlying implementation.
    - Remove the definition of "THAT function" from the entry point file.
    - If any test files use this function, update those tests to test against the new underlying implementation instead. Check if there are already existing tests for the underlying implementation to avoid duplicate testing.
    -  Ensure that modified tests pass.
2. Loop through all public functions in the entry point file until all have been removed.
3. After there is no public functions in the entry point file, delete the entry point file from the project.
4. Make sure all tests pass again.
5. Commit your changes and explain in your commit message that you have removed the old entry point and describe related modifications.

Let's do this step by step.
